<H1>Sound Creation</h1>


<h2>Speech</h2>
To create the sounds used in this demo, a number of steps were involved.<p>

First, the room designs were created and analyzed with the 
<a href="http://www.netg.se/~catt/">CATT acoustics</a> program.  CATT generated an <a href="glossary.html#impulse_response">impulse response</a> for a given source and receiver location.
<p>
The <a href="glossary.html#impulse_response">impulse responses</a> were generated using the generic <a href="glossary.html#hrtf">head related transfer function</a> (HRTF)  as supplied with CATT and equalized for Sennheiser HD440 headphones.
<p>
Then, the <a href="glossary.html#impulse_response">impulse response</a> was convolved with the anechoic samples, again using 
<a href="http://www.netg.se/~catt/">CATT acoustics</a>, to generate the sounds
in the different rooms.  Finally, the sounds
were adjusted so that the maximum amplitude was the same in all cases for better comparison
using <a href="http://www.syntrillium.com">Cooledit96</a>
