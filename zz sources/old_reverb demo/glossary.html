<P><a name="direct_sound"><H3>Direct Sound</h3></a></P>
Sound that travels directly from the source to the listener without any reflections.

<P><a name="echo"><H3>Echo</h3></a></P>
An echo is a sound reflection that can be disinctly heard.  Usually
for a reflection to become an echo, it must be received more than 50-60 milliseconds after the direct sound and must be distinctly louder than any other reflections.

<P><a name="hrtf"><H3>Head Related Transfer Function (HRTF)</h3></a></P>
The head related transfer function (hrtf) describes the variation of sound pressure that results from the sound traveling around the head.  These variations help people,  in part, to determine the direction from which a sound has come.

<P><a name="impulse_reponse"><H3>Impulse Response</h3></a></P>
The impulse response is sound pressure created from an impulsive source such as a balloon popping or a gunshot.  A room without reflections has a only single impulse of sound arrive at the receiver.  A room with reflections has a number of impulses of different amplitude arriving a different times.  The collection of impulses is called the impulse
response.  The length (in time) of the impulse response is indicative of its reverberation time.  A room with high absorption on most walls will have an impulse response that is very short (say, less than a second) in length as sound is almost completely absorbed after only a few reflections.

<P><a name="reverberation"><h3>Reverberation</h3></a></P>
The sound in a room that is not direct, i.e. it all the sound that has been bouncing around the room off of the walls, floors, ceiling, etc.

<P><a name="reverberation_time"><H3>Reverberation Time</h3></a></P>
The time it takes, in seconds, for the sound reflections in the room to be absorbed.   More technically, it is the amount of time for the sound power to drop to 1/1,000,000 of its original level.  Most rooms have reverberation times in the 0.5s to 6s.  A very "dead" room has a short reverberation time while a "live" room has a longer reverberation time.
Larger rooms generally have larger reverberation times simply because it takes longer for the sound to travel around the room.  Rooms with short reverberation times are good for speech while rooms with medium reverberation times (2-3s) are good for solo or orchestral music.  Rooms with long reverberation times are good for organ music and chant.
