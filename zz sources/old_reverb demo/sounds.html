<H1>Sound Signal Descriptions</h1>


<h2>Speech</h2>
The segment of speech came with the <a href="http://www.netg.se/~catt/">CATT acoustics</a> program.  It is 
sampled with 16 bit resolution at 22 kHz.<p>
Speech is best heard in an auditorium environment where there are early reflections which enhance the voice, but the sound dies out fairly quickly to aid intelligibility.

<h2>Piano</h2>

The segment of piano music comes from the Mozart Piano Sonata in C, K545.<p>

The music was generated electronically from a MIDI file of the piano sonata and
rendered with Audio Compositor software package.  The piano "soft font" audio samples
were obtained from <a href="http://www.trachtman.org">Warren Trackman's Grand Piano Sound Fonts</a> which were created from close mic recordings of a Steinway grand piano.  <p>

Music of this sort is designed to be heard in a large room with a bit of 
<a href="glossary.html#reverberation">reverberation</a>.  The <a href="glossary.html#reverberation">reverberation</a> helps give the piano its full tone.  Without <a href="glossary.html#reverberation">reverberation</a> the piano seems to lack much bass and sounds much too tinny.

<h2>Organ</h2>

The segment of organ music comes from Bach's Tocatta and Fugue in D minor <p>

Most organ music is designed to be played in a room with a lot of 
<a href="glossary.html#reverberation">reverberation</a> and this piece is no exception.  Bach intentionally made use of reverberation to create complex harmonies and counterpoint.  This piece sounds far more complex, but still completely intelligible, in the cathedral environment than in the anechoic space.
<p>

The music was generated electronically from a MIDI file of the organ piece and rendered with Audio Compositor software package.  The organ "soft font" audio samples were obtained from the 
<a href="http://taeback.kornet.nm.kr/~chaos/soundfont/chaosbank.htm">Chaos Bank Sound Font</a>.
