<H1> Room Descriptions</h1>

<h2>Anechoic Room (No Reflections)</h2>

An anechoic, or echoless room, is a room that has total absorption on all surfaces. 
This means that any sound that hits a wall is completely absorbed and none is reflected.
<p>
Because the anechoic room has no sound reflections, there is no <a href="glossary.html#reverberation">reverberation</a> and
<a href="glossary.html#reverberation_time">reverberation time</a> and the
<a href="glossary.html#impulse_response">impulse response</a> is a true impulse, meaning it
looks like a spike.
 
<p>
Anechoic rooms are used in measuring sound generated by various objects and in 
acoustic testing of people and animals.
<p>
Being outdoors on a calm day well away from any reflecting surfaces is a good approximation 
to an anechoic room.

<h2>Auditorium</h2>

An auditorium is a room that is mainly designed for the presentation of the spoken word.  Such a room should have some reflections but not too many.  Reflections that arrive within 50 milliseconds (or so) of the <a href="glossary.html#direct_sound">direct sound </a>
may enhance the intelligibility of the speech, however later reflections can decrease speech intelligibility.  To achieve this goal, surfaces near the source might be reflecting while surfaces far from the source might be absorbing </a> 
<p>
The auditorium for this demonstration would hold 500-700 people.  It has a 
<a href="glossary.html#reverberation_time">reverberation time</a> of under 1 second.

<h2>Recital Hall</h2>

A recital hall is a room that is designed for the presentation of solo musical instruments and small ensembles.  Such a room has a good number of reflections.  Later reflections help to add fullness to the sound of the instruments.  While the reflections are needed to enhance the tonal quality (or timbre) of the instruments, it makes it difficult to understand speech in the room. In addition, the reflecting surfaces of the room are designed in such a way as to eliminate distinct 
<a href="glossary.html#echo">echoes</a> that could take place when sound is not absorbed quickly.

<p>
The recital hall for this demonstration would hold 500-700 people.  It has a <a href="glossary.html#reverberation_time">reverberation time</a> of about 1.5 to 2 seconds.
<p>

<h2>Cathedral</h2>

A gothic or baroque cathedral is a room that is often designed for organ music and chant. Both forms make use of long <a href="glossary.html#reverberation_time">reverberation times</a> to enhance the performance of the music.  In a cathedral, a sound from a voice or instrument continues reflecting around the room for a long time and will mix with the next note, creating a far more complex piece of music.
<p>
Cathedrals can have extremely long <a href="glossary.html#reverberation_time">reverberation time</a> (upwards of 6 seconds!).  Much of the reason for this is that the walls, floors, and ceilings are made of polished stone and wood which do not absorb much sound.  In fact, the largest sound absorber in most cathedrals is the people who are inside of the room.
<p>
The cathedral in this demonstration was assumed empty and designed with an 
 <a href="glossary.html#reverberation_time"> 
reverberation time of 5-6 seconds.
